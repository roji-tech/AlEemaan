// The start of a RESUMED recon (task 0033, section 6.16): the database was restored from a checkpoint, so the instance is set up and the browser is new. Like a person coming back to the
// school's address, the walk is on the front page (its one landing), chooses the theme, presses Sign in and signs in as the superadministrator. It is not a chapter of the journey: no steps,
// nothing in the timeline, and it runs only when WALKTHROUGH_ONLY is set. The chapter that follows begins by signing out, as every chapter written from C16 on does.
