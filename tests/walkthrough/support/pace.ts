/**
 * Pacing for the continuous product walkthrough.
 *
 * The person in the video is a very fast human (decided 2026-11-06): quick, sure movements and a very fast typist, never a robot. The pauses around a click (glide, hover, settle,
 * dwell) can be shortened further with WALKTHROUGH_SPEED_SCALE for a recon run. Typing cannot: it stays one real key press at a time, 35 to 80 ms apart (about 200 words a minute,
 * with the unevenness of a hand), because a constant or near-zero delay is a script, not a person. The scale never touches key delays.
