/**
 * Dedicated Playwright configuration for the continuous walkthrough (AlEemaan).
 *
 * Completely apart from the normal suites (unit, integration, api, e2e, https): it is not in playwright.config.ts and not in `pnpm check`.
 *
 * Projects:
 *   support         the harness's own tests (the guard, the coverage gate, the observers, the walk helpers). No browser recording.
 *   desktop-light   one pass of the whole journey at 1280 x 720, light theme.
 *   desktop-dark    the same, dark theme (chosen by clicking the theme toggle, which is a step of the journey).
 *   phone           the same on a Pixel 7.
 * Each pass starts from its own fresh database and is one continuous recording; run them one at a time (scripts/walkthrough-run/run.mjs does).
 *
 * No retries, no parallelism, ever: a step that fails is a finding, and a rerun that passes would hide it.
